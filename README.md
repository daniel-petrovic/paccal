# Transform Pascal to C

Pascal was my first programming language I learned.

Recently I got an interesting idea about creating a source code transformer from pascal to  C/C++.

I found this idea very interesting and I will try to use some of my spare time to create such a transformer, starting in the first step with transforming to C and then optionally in the second step extending to the C++ transform, if meaningful.

I didn't research if such a similar transformer already exists somewhere in the wild,  but I'd like to make an adventure journey. I start from scratch using some previous experience I've made with LLVM/clang and creating a custom C parser. I'm not an expert in this field, but let's see how far I can get.

I will try to create small daily or weekly improvements, as long my time allows -  probably have a hour or two in the evening or on weekends.

I will also try reporting the progress as I go.
